# Bashscripts
Random bash scripts that I use to survive.

## Random Wallpaper
I have a folder with wallpapers that I can randomly switch between with an hotkey in my i3 config.

## Fix files
Scripts like mirror_fix.sh,fix_frame_rate etc that I use when something breaks. For example
sometimes my frame rate is at 60hz instead of 144hz so I use fix_frame_rate with an hotkey that fixes this.

## Sessions
I use session.sh to quickly switch between projects or create new ones.
